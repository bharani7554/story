mkdir story
cd story
touch chapter1.txt
open -a /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app chapter1.txt
git init  - It is the working directory for git.
ls -a
git status - current files in working directory and we are changing to status files by using add.
git add chapter1.txt
git commit -m "complete chapter1"
git log


If we updated any file then run git add <file name> and git commit -m "" in command line.


If you updated and see the difference between the present file and changes before file.
Then use git diff chapter3.txt
Or if you want previous saved file then use git checkout chapter3.txt

Git is save the code at point to point.
If we lost the code or we get an error and code is lost, then we go to before that we saved using  git.
Here commit is for that. We can see using commit.


It was the best time to do.
